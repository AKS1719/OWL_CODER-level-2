<h2>Expression Evaluation</h2> <img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-brightgreen' alt='Difficulty: Medium' /><hr>
<p>
  You are developing a program that evaluates expressions of the form "x A y B z C," where x, y, and z are placeholders for integers, and A, B, and C are placeholders for operators that can be either addition (+) or subtraction (-).

Your task is to determine if there exists any combination of operators for A, B, and C that, when applied to the integers x, y, and z, will result in an expression that evaluates to 0. If such a combination exists, you should print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO."

<strong>Input format:</strong>
<p>First line contains T, number of test cases.

Next T lines contains three integers A, B and C.</p>
<strong>Output format:</strong>
<p>Print the output string "YES" or "NO" based on given condion.</p>
